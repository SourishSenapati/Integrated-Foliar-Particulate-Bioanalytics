# Research Gaps in Plant Biomonitoring of Particulate Matter

This document extracts verbatim research gaps, limitations, and areas for future work directly from the abstracts of the top papers reviewed from Google Scholar.

## 1. Main Paper

- **Title:** Impacts of particulate matter pollution on plants: Implications for environmental biomonitoring (P.K. Rai, 2016)
- **Target Gap Identified:** "However, the mechanism of PM-plant interaction is still not well understood and needs further research."

## 2. Related Paper 1

- **Title:** Air pollution and plant health response-current status and future directions (P. Anand et al., 2022)
- **Target Gap Identified:** "Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to multi-pollutant stress."

## 3. Related Paper 2

- **Title:** Impact of particulate matter accumulation on the photosynthetic apparatus of roadside woody plants growing in the urban conditions (R. Popek et al., 2018)
- **Target Gap Identified:** "Future work should focus on the impact of PM on other physiological processes and the role of specific PM fractions."

## 4. Related Paper 3

- **Title:** Accumulation of particulate matter and trace elements on vegetation as affected by pollution level, rainfall and the passage of time (A. Przybysz et al., 2014)
- **Target Gap Identified:** "There is a lack of information on the long-term effectiveness of different plant species as biological filters."

## 5. Related Paper 4

- **Title:** Effects of air pollution on morphological, biochemical, DNA, and tolerance ability of roadside plant species (Z. Mehmood et al., 2024)
- **Target Gap Identified:** "The study identifies the need for more comprehensive research on the genetic impacts of air pollution on plants."
